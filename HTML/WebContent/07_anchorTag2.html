	<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
	random text.It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
	literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
	Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
	College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
	words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and 
	going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
	discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes 
	from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum 
	et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, 
	written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of 
	ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line 
	of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes 
	from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
